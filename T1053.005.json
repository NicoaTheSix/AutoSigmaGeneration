The MITRE ATT&CK technique we want to detect is:

TTP Name: User Execution: Malicious File  
TTP ID: T1053.005
    "Description": "Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. Theschtasksutility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel.[1]In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library andWindows Management Instrumentation(WMI) to create a scheduled task. Adversaries may also utilize the Powershell CmdletInvoke-CimMethod, which leverages WMI classPS_ScheduledTaskto create a scheduled task via an XML path.[2]An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar toSystem Binary Proxy Execution, adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.[3]Adversaries may also create \"hidden\" scheduled tasks (i.e.Hide Artifacts) that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. Specifically, an adversary may hide a task fromschtasks /queryand the Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).[4][5]Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g.,Indexvalue) within associated registry keys.[6]",

Please identify the behavioral patterns from these examples and relate them to the technique described above.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Likely attack patterns for T1053.005 (Malicious File Execution) may include:
1. Use of schtasks.exe with suspicious command-line options
Common switches:

/create: explicitly creating new tasks

/tn: task name (frequently suspicious or impersonating legitimate tasks)

/tr: task payload, often pointing to malware (e.g., .exe, .vbs, PowerShell, etc.)

/ru: often SYSTEM, LOCAL SERVICE, or current user

/sc: frequency (e.g., minute, onlogon, once, daily)

/f: force creation (overwriting tasks)

Suspicious task names:

Impersonating legitimate ones: WinUpdate, Java Maintenance64, MicrosoftEdge, Google Chrome Update, IE Web Cache, etc.

Generic or disguised names: qqmusic, BigData, Update, Maintenance, StartDVL, etc.

2. Task creation pointing to suspicious binaries or scripts
Task payload (/tr) points to:

Files in unusual or user-writable paths: %APPDATA%, %TEMP%, C:\Users\Public\

Scripting engines: wscript.exe, cscript.exe, powershell.exe, rundll32.exe

Files with misleading names or double extensions (e.g., update.doc.exe, googleupdate.vbs)

Remotely hosted files or dropped malware

Execution of .dll, .vbe, .bat, .ps1, .vbs files

3. Scheduled Task creation via alternate interfaces
PowerShell WMI method: Invoke-CimMethod + PS_ScheduledTask class

Task Scheduler COM interfaces or native APIs (via .NET, IronPython)

XML-based task registration (e.g., via schtasks /create /XML)

Registry modification of scheduled task definitions (to hide tasks or manipulate their behavior)

4. Frequent execution intervals or execution-on-boot/login
Very short intervals (/sc minute /mo 1) → indicative of beaconing or persistence

Triggers like /sc onlogon, /sc onstart, /sc once for persistence or stealthy one-time execution

5. Scheduled Tasks used for lateral movement
Remote task creation:

/S <ip> + /U <user> + /P <password> on target hosts (as seen in Impacket-based campaigns)

6. Hidden or stealth task manipulation
Tasks that do not appear in schtasks /query

Registry tampering (e.g., removing Security Descriptor or modifying metadata to hide tasks)


Registry Artifacts:

Scheduled task information may be altered in the registry (e.g., hiding via SD value deletion)
Please keep these scenarios in mind when constructing detection logic for this technique.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following detection techniques are commonly used to identify this TTP:

      "Monitor for commands being executed via schtasks or other utilities related to task scheduling.Analytic 1 - Look for schtasks.exe execution with arguments indicative of task creation/modification.sourcetype=WinEventLog:Powershell (EventCode=4104 OR command=\"schtasks.exe\")| stats count by user host process_name command_line| where Image=\"schtasks.exe\" OR command_line=\"schtasks\"",
      "Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in %systemroot%\\System32\\Tasks for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. In order to gain persistence, privilege escalation, or remote execution, an adversary may use the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a command to be run at a specified time, date, and even host. Task Scheduler stores tasks as files in two locations - C:\\Windows\\Tasks (legacy) or C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks. Accordingly, this analytic looks for the creation of task files in these two locations.Analytic 1 - Look for new task files in %systemroot%\\System32\\Tasks.((source=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"11\") OR (sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4663)) (TargetFilename= \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\\" OR TargetFilename  \"C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\*\")  AND Image!= \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\svchost.exe\"",
      "Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in %systemroot%\\System32\\Tasks for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc.Analytic 1 - Look for task file modifications with unusual parameters.sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security (EventCode=4663 OR file_path=\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\*\")| stats count by user host file_path action| where action=\"Write\" OR action=\"Create\"",
      "Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Look for RPC traffic after being mapped, which implies a destination port of at least 49152. If network inspection is available via packet captures or a NIDS, then traffic through theITaskSchedulerServiceinterface can be detected. Microsoft has a list of the possible methods that are implemented for theITaskSchedulerServiceinterface, which may be useful in differentiating read and query operations from creations and modifications.When scheduled tasks are created remotely, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the Task Scheduler on the remote machine. Once an RPC connection is established, the client communicates with the Scheduled Tasks endpoint, which runs within the service group netsvcs. With packet capture and the right packet decoders or byte-stream based signatures, remote invocations of these functions can be identified.Certain strings can be identifiers of the schtasks, by looking up the interface UUID of ITaskSchedulerService in different formatsUUID86d35949-83c9-4044-b424-db363231fd0c(decoded)Hex49 59 d3 86 c9 83 44 40 b4 24 db 36 32 31 fd 0c(raw)ASCIIIYD@$621(printable bytes only)This identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase. Any sensor that has access to the byte code as raw, decoded, or ASCII could implement an analytic.Analytic 1 - Look for RPC traffic with ITaskSchedulerService interface usage.sourcetype=Netflow OR sourcetype=PacketCapture OR sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=5156 | search (dest_port=135 OR dest_port=5985 OR dest_port=5986) AND (protocol=\"tcp\" OR protocol=\"udp\")  AND (Image=\"taskeng.exe\" OR Image=\"schtasks.exe\")| stats count by src_ip dest_ip dest_port| where count > threshold",
      "Monitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines that execute from the svchost.exe in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler taskeng.exe for older versions of Windows.[232]If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Look for instances ofschtasks.exerunning as processes. Thecommand_linefield is necessary to disambiguate between types of schtasks commands.

Please analyze how these detection methods map to the suspicious behaviors described above.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our detection events follow this schema:

Each event contains:
- srcNode: The source entity (usually a process)
  - Fields: UUID, Name, Image, Cmdline, Type, Pid
- dstNode: The destination entity (may be null or Process, File, Registry, or Network)
  - Fields: UUID, Name or Path or Key, Image, Cmdline, Dstaddress, Port, Type
- relation: Describes the action from source to destination
  - Possible values:
    - File: CreateFile, WriteFile, ReadFile, CloseFile, etc.
    - Process: Process Start, Process Create
    - Network: TCP Connect, TCP Send, UDP Receive, etc.
    - Registry: RegOpenKey, RegSetValue, RegQueryValue, etc.
- timestamp: UNIX timestamp
- label: Ground-truth label (e.g., benign or TTP ID)

Example event:
{
  "srcNode": {
    "Image": "C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe",
    "Cmdline": "C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe",
    "Type": "Process"
  },
  "dstNode": {
    "Image": "C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\malware.scr",
    "Cmdline": "C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\malware.scr",
    "Type": "Process"
  },
  "relation": "Process Create"
}

Now, based on the above information, please generate a complete Sigma rule in valid YAML format.

Special instructions (additions):
- Include separate detection blocks for:
  1) Process Create|Start of risky extensions
  2) Office/Browser CreateFile|WriteFile of risky extensions
  3) Two-stage chain: Office -> cmd|powershell -> wscript|cscript|rundll32
- When dstNode.Image is null, fall back to dstNode.Name
- Directory check: raise if path NOT under \Windows\system32 OR \Program Files, or simply omit directory filter
- Detect double-extension camouflage (regex: \.(doc|pdf|xls)\s*\.(exe|scr|vbs)$)
- Support both Process Create and Process Start

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your output must include the following fields:
