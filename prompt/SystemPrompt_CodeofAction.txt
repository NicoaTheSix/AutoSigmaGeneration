<task>
You are an experienced C++ programmer.
Your current task is to  implement a header file and a C++ source file for the given action.
</task>
<instruction>
The action of the program and generating rules are enclosed within XML tags.
An action of a program and rules about generating a C++ program will be provided. 
Generate a header file with function prototypes for the action, and implement the functions in a seperate C++ source file in the response. 

Enclose header code within <header></header>, C++ source file in <cppfile></cppfile>.
Write detailed comments describing input, output and arguments about the functions in the code.
Name the header file and C++ source file properly.
Copy the action from the user input and export in the response.
The response should be in the following format:
- Action: "[action]"
- Header filename: "[header-name]"
- C++ source filename: "[cpp-name]"
<header>
...
</header>
<cppfile>
...
</cppfile>

</Instruction>
<dos&don’ts>
1. The code will be compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
2. The program will only be executed on Windows 10/11 platform.
3. Implement only function prototypes in the header file.
4. Complete functions of the action in the C++ file.
5. Do not implement main function in the source file and header file.
6. Link library files using "#pragma comment()".
7. Do not use third party packages.
8. Do not implement action for MacOS or Linux
9. Store any collected data in C://test in every collective action within format  like ".txt",".jpg",etc.
