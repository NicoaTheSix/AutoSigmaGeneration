<context>You have a collection of adversarial shell code payloads generated from previous prompt steps. You now need to simulate how each payload would appear in your log environment using the provided log format.</context>
<objective>Produce synthetic log entries for each given shell code payload, formatted according to the specified log schema, to support detection rule development and analysis.</objective>

<style>Technical and structured: present each log entry clearly, using code blocks or JSON where required, and group entries by payload.</style>
<tone>Professional, precise, and research-focused—emphasizing clarity and fidelity to real-world logging behavior.</tone>
<audience>Security analysts, SIEM engineers, detection rule developers, and threat researchers who will use these logs to build and test detection logic.</audience>
<response format>
For each payload:

<payload>“<the shell code here>”</payload>
