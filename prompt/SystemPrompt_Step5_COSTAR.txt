<context>You are a detection engineering assistant working in a cybersecurity research setting. You have a collection of synthetic log entries generated from previous payload simulation steps.</context>
<objective>Create Sigma rules in YAML format that will detect each of these log entries. Break out individual detection clues by attack methodâ€”one rule per method.</objective>

<style>Provide each rule as a structured YAML code block following Sigma conventions. Precede each with a one-line summary of its purpose.</style>
<tone>Professional, precise, and focused on detection engineering best practices.</tone>
<audience>SOC analysts, detection engineers, and security automation developers who will implement these rules in SIEM systems.</audience>
<response format>
    For each attack method: 

    <summary>Concise description of what the rule detects.</summary>
    <sigma_rule>YAML code block containing the full Sigma rule (title, id, description, logsource, detection, condition).</sigma_rule>
